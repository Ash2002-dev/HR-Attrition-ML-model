# 💼 HR Attrition Prediction

This project aims to analyze employee data and predict attrition using machine learning techniques. Employee attrition is a major concern for organizations, and data-driven insights can help businesses take proactive steps to retain their workforce.

---

## 📌 Objective

Build and evaluate predictive models that can determine whether an employee is likely to leave the organization, based on HR attributes.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Main programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive coding and analysis
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models & PCA

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Load and explore the HR dataset  
2. Clean and preprocess the data  
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
4. Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction  
5. Train machine learning models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree / Random Forest
6. Evaluate model performance with metrics like Accuracy, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC

---

## 📈 Model Results

> Replace with actual values from your notebook:

- **Best Accuracy**: 85.3%
- **F1 Score**: 82.1%
- **ROC-AUC**: 88.6%

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Employees working **OverTime** are more likely to leave.
- **JobSatisfaction** and **EnvironmentSatisfaction** play significant roles.
- **YearsAtCompany** and **WorkLifeBalance** are also important predictors.
